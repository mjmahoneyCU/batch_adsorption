    Before running your simulation, adjust the sliders below to explore how different system parameters affect batch adsorption performance. Here‚Äôs what each parameter means:

    - **Initial Concentration (C‚ÇÄ)**: The starting concentration of protein in the liquid phase (mg/mL). Higher values mean more protein is available for adsorption.

    - **Adsorption Rate Constant (k)**: A lumped kinetic parameter (1/min) that captures how quickly adsorption occurs. It reflects both mass transfer limitations and surface reaction kinetics.

    - **Langmuir Constant (K_Langmuir)**: Defines how tightly the protein binds to the resin. A lower value means tighter binding (higher affinity); a higher value indicates weaker binding.

    - **Maximum Resin Capacity (qmax)**: The maximum amount of protein the resin can hold per mL of resin volume (mg/mL resin). This defines the adsorption saturation limit.

    - **Simulation Time**: The total duration (in minutes) for which the batch process is simulated. Keep in mind that most adsorption processes reach near-equilibrium within 30 minutes.

# --- CONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS ---
with st.expander("üß† Making Sense of the Simulation", expanded=False):
    st.markdown("""
### 1. What factors control how fast the system reaches equilibrium?
**Try this:**  
Set `k = 0.2`, run the simulation. Then increase to `k = 2.0`.  
Keep `C‚ÇÄ = 20`, `qmax = 65`, `KL = 0.15`.

**What should you observe?**  
- **Answer**: Increasing `k` makes the system reach equilibrium faster, but the final resin loading and final concentration remain the same. The rate constant affects **speed**, not **final state**.

---

### 2. How does initial concentration (C‚ÇÄ) affect the final resin loading and equilibrium concentration?
**Try this:**  
Run simulations with `C‚ÇÄ = 5`, `20`, and `40`. Keep `qmax`, `k`, and `KL` constant.

**What should you observe?**  
- **Answer**: Higher `C‚ÇÄ` generally leads to higher final resin loading. However, the resin will saturate if `qmax` is too low, so the effect of increasing `C‚ÇÄ` plateaus. The final liquid concentration will also be higher with higher starting amounts.

---

### 3. How does resin capacity (qmax) influence the system‚Äôs behavior?
**Try this:**  
Use `qmax = 20`, `65`, and `100` with fixed `C‚ÇÄ = 20`.

**What should you observe?**  
- **Answer**: Larger `qmax` values allow more protein to bind before saturation. This lowers the final liquid concentration and increases resin loading. However, beyond a certain point, adding more capacity has little effect if all protein is already adsorbed.

---

### 4. What does the Langmuir constant (KL) tell us about binding affinity?
**Try this:**  
Run with `KL = 0.01`, `0.1`, and `0.5`. Keep `C‚ÇÄ = 20`, `qmax = 65`.

**What should you observe?**  
- **Answer**: Lower `KL` values indicate **tighter binding** (higher affinity). When `KL` is small, the resin binds more strongly even at low concentrations, resulting in lower final liquid concentration. At high `KL`, weaker binding results in less adsorption.

---

### 5. Is adsorption limited by capacity or affinity?
**Try this:**  
- Case 1: `C‚ÇÄ = 5`, `KL = 0.5`  
- Case 2: `C‚ÇÄ = 5`, `KL = 0.05`  
Hold other values constant.

**What should you observe?**  
- **Answer**: When C‚ÇÄ is low, **binding affinity (KL)** matters more than `qmax`. If KL is high (weak binding), little protein adsorbs. Even if `qmax` is large, low affinity limits adsorption.

---

### 6. How does simulation time affect the results?
**Try this:**  
Run with `t_end = 5`, `15`, and `30` minutes for the same parameter set.

**What should you observe?**  
- **Answer**: Shorter simulation time may stop before the system reaches equilibrium. If the curves are still changing at `t_end`, try increasing it. Equilibrium is reached when curves flatten.

---

### 7. What parameter set leads to the most complete removal of protein?
**Challenge:**  
Try to reduce final liquid concentration below `1 mg/mL`.

**What should you observe?**  
- **Answer**: Use **high `qmax`**, **low KL** (tight binding), and a **moderate-to-high k**. Also, avoid starting with a very high C‚ÇÄ. This will maximize adsorption and reduce unbound protein.
